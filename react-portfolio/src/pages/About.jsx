          <p>
            I grew up in Greeley, Colorado with my 3 older brothers. As I grew
            up, I took interest in many different things like reading and video
            games. Throughout my life, I had always ahd interests in creative
            writing and stroy-telling, but also technical things like computer
            software and Hardware. at 18 I built my first PC and hve been doing
            it as a hobby since. My undergraduate degree was a BA in Journalism
            with a minor in Earth Science. I graduated directly into the
            pandameic and was at a total loss for jobs. At this time I continued
            to work for my internship site, The Johnstown Breeze as I picked up
            substitute teaching. After a few years of being a substitute, I
            spent a year teaching English at the charter school Leman Academy of
            Excellence.

            In my time as a teacher I took a lot of time to reflect on my
            professional life. I decided that work was most satisfying for me in
            a role that focused on technical performance and learning. Because
            of my love for tech, I enrolled in the full stack coding bootcamp at
            DU that I finished off in February. So far coding has given me such
            a great experience I havent' gotten from any other job and every day
            feels exciting and rewarding. I am excited to enter into the field
            and I feel like I have truly found a job I can do for life.

            Right now I live in Lone Tree with my beautiful wife Kyleigh and out
            dog Opal. Kyleigh works as an audiologist at Integrated Ear, Nose,
            and Throat. We both hope to find steady jobs so that we may grow our
            family in the future.
